# FMAR System Use Case Catalogue

This document outlines the latest thinking on core system use cases that we are focusing on in our Flexibility Market Asset Registration (FMAR) solution workshops.

**What is FMAR**: In short, the FMAR solution is an IT system that helps to keep track of (register) data about flexible assets and flexibility service providers. It would provide a source of truth on this data and provide common-levels of access to industry (and individual) users, underpinned by a common data model and shared ontology for GB flexibility markets. It will be an essential part of a future flexibility value chain to support decarbonisation and realise the business (and public) value expanded on [here](https://github.com/elexon-data/Market-Facilitator/tree/main/docs/Market_Facilitator/FMAR_Design/Ecosystem_Architecture/Business%20Use%20Case%20Catalogue). 

The following very rough diagram illustrates the concept of the FMAR solution in the GB energy market. The red line text indicates some of the many unanswered questions about how FMAR relates to the broader ecosystem.

The FMAR workshops will work through the many unanswered questions related to the FMAR solution. This diagram should serve as a starting point for discussion and one way to visualise the concept we are developing.

*Note on new System Use Case group being explored (will add soon if supported in WS2)*

System Use Case Group explicitly related to **Data Quality Management** which would specify system uses cases for: 
* Define and maintain DQ Rules (Admin)
* Validate and score data at ingestion
* View data quality scorecard
* Manage a data discrepancy 



*Note on Module terminology*

As part of early thinking on FMAR functionality a set of modules were introduced in Workshop 1. The modules illustrate that FMAR intends to operate through modular components with some data flows potentially using a federated architecture via the DSI (e.g., enabling a resource synchronisation strategy). The modules reflect logical groupings to the lifecycle of asset data in the Qualification phase of flexibility markets.

# Module Key
- **SPUM** â€“ Service Provider & User Module  
- **ARM** â€“ Asset Registration Module  
- **PSQM** â€“ Product & Service Qualification Module  
- **GICM** â€“ Grid Interaction & Constraints Module
